           <h1> WHAT IS BUYER PERSONA?</h1>
           <p>A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of an ideal customer based on real data and some educated speculation about demographics, behaviours, motivation and goals. Personas are created through research, analysis, and taking a close look at who is already buying from you.</p>
           <p>Having a persona to address is really powerful as it will help marketers know the right channels to use and the right content to create to attract the right people. It can also help a sales person know the right questions to ask during a sales presentation.</p>
           <h2>BUYER'S JOURNEY</h2>
           <p>Buyer's journey is the active research process someone goes through leading up to a purchase. Knowing the buyer's journey for your persona will be key to creating the best content.</p>
           <p>The buyer's journey comprises of three stages, although some articles say four; but for the sake of this work, we will leave it at three. They are:</p>
           <dl>
            <dt style="color: tomato;">Awareness Stage</dt>
            <dd>When your prospect is experiencing and expressing symptoms of a problem or opportunity, they would do research to name the probelem or know more about it.</dd>
            <dt style="color: tomato;">consideration Stage</dt>
            <dd>When your prospect has clearly defined and given a name to their problem or opportunity, they are committed to knowing all the methods and processes involved in solving a problem or the problem.</dd>
            <dt style="color: tomato;">Decision Stage</dt>
            <dd>When your prospect has decided on their solution, strategy or approach.</dd>
           </dl>
           <p>The education you provide with your content could help a client solve a problem.</p>

           <h2>Three Key Car Buyers To Know</h2>
           <div class="PB">
            <p>Just to illustrate what a buyer persona is, we will be looking at three key buyer personas from <a href="https://snapcell.us.com/three-key-car-buyer-personas-that-you-should-know/">snapcell.us.com</a></p>
           <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Micheal:The Milennial</h3>
           <p>With recent statistics showing that millennials have become the largest car buying demographic in America, it makes sense that our first buyer persona comes from this generation</p>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Name:</span> Michael (the most popular name for millennials, so calling him Michael makes sense).</p>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Age:</span> 32</p>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Education:</span>Michael is a college graduate (note, millenials are the most educated demographic, but that also means they come with the most student debt).</p>
           <P><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Lifestyle:</span>Michael is engaged, living with his partner but is yet to have children – although he has settled down and is planning to start a family in the next five years (while they have settled down, an increase in student debt has seen millennials delaying having children). Michael lives in the suburbs, commuting into the city for his job – your dealership should use this information, to promote cars ideal for commuting.</P>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Finances:</span> Michael works in the city, earning around $70,000 pre-tax, every year – he wants a car which is affordable.</p>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Personality:</span>Michael doesn’t like to follow the crowd, wants something a bit different or unique to them.</p>
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Hobbies:</span>Michael works hard, so he has fun during his spare time. When he’s not working, he’s off visiting family, or enjoying road trips. He enjoys the beach in the summer and hitting the slopes in the winter – practicality is a priority.</p> 
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Goals:</span>Michael needs a car that comes with all the technology, so he can listen to podcasts and music while driving, along with his phone when navigating.</p> 
           <p><span style="color: blanchedalmond;">Automotive Shopping Trends:</span>Michael wants a quick but professional sales experience, and doesn’t want to be wasting time waiting to take part in a test drive or filling out paperwork. Use the SnapCell app to quickly show Michael a two-minute virtual test drive, allowing him to experience the car easily.</p>
           <p>For Michael, car buying is all about convenience – he’s done his research and now he wants a seamless shopping experience. It’s important your dealership treats him with respect, acknowledging that he knows the sector. The chances are he knows what type of car he wants before visiting you.</p>
           <p>Consider showing Michael your electric vehicle range – he will know that electric vehicles will be big in the future, and will want to keep on trend.</p>
           <p style="color: blanchedalmond;"><i>Michael: A 32-year-old man who is looking for a practical, affordable but modern-day vehicle, ideal for long road trips to both the beach and slops. He needs a vehicle with space for luggage, along with extra passengers and one that will sustain daily commutes into the city.</i></p>
